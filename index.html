        <h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>
        <h3>
          How has the population in the United Stated by sex changed between
          1900 and 2000?
        </h3>

        <p>Design Rationale for Sketch 1:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I wanted to communicate the quantity of the change in the population
            between 1900 and 2000.
          </li>
          <li>
            However, I think using 4 separate colors can come across as
            confusing or too much to the viewer.
          </li>
          <li>Difficult to differentiate year and sex.</li>
          <li>How can I better depict the trend for increase in population?</li>
        </ul>

        </figure>

        <p>Design Rationale for Sketch 2:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Inspired by traditional population pyramids.</li>
          <li>
            I layered the population by year to show the increase and change in
            population, which seems more effective than the previous sketch.
          </li>
          <li>
            How can I explore an alternative way of depicting the change in
            population without labeling?
          </li>
        </ul>

        <figure>
          <img src="sketch3.png" alt="" width="700px" />
          <figcaption>
            Sketch Iteration: Change in Population by Sex between 1900 to 2000
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Rationale for Sketch 3:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I used a circular shape to allude to a sense of lifetime and time
            with respect to age.
          </li>
          <li>I used the opacity technique from the previous sketch.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>

        <p>
          Out of my three sketches, I think the last two are stronger than the
          first in terms of clarity. The latter two simplify the number of keys
          necessary to understand the visualization. Furthermore, they more
          clearly show the increase in population over almost all age groups by
          use of opacity. The last sketch gives a better sense of age with its
          clock-like nature and also allows the viewer to compare the population
          of men and women (by year) within in slice, where as the second sketch
          does not depict that as well due to bigger separation of men and
          women. In the next phase, I will explore the use of more similar
          colors (blue and purple), to avoid perpetuation of gender stereotypes
          and the lightness of the axes to better emphasize the data.

        <h2>Phase Two: Final Design</h2>

        <h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

        <p>
          For this dataset, I wanted to emphasize and communicate the
          significant increase in population by both genders between 1900 and
          2000. Using my sketches from phase one, I explored different way to
          depict the change in population and decided to build upon my last
          sketch.
        </p>
        <p>
          For my final design, I used a circular, clock-like format of a bar
          chart to depict the population and evoke a sense of time. I used a
          linear scale to emphasize the change (compared to a logarithmic one,
          which would decrease the sense of increase). I labeled each section of
          the circle by the starting age number. Furthermore, I divided each
          section of the circular to have both male and female populations for
          easy comparison and used varying line colors to differentiate each age
          range. Furthermore, I used different color opacities between years to
          effectively highlight the change from 1900 to 2000, since the
          population has increased for all age groups. One aspect of data that
          may be downplayed is the increase from population by year and by
          gender as the slices for male and female populations are alternating,
          and thus their individual trends (although one can still see it relatively well)
          may not be as starkly visible.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>

        <p> Phase one helped my develop my design for this assignment. The iterations were very helpful in breaking away from standard visualization (e.g. bar chart and population pyramid).
			For isntance, I kept the idea of layering opacity, because of its effectiveness in showing change from a common "base level."
			One aspect of my sketches that also greatly influenced my final design was the emphasis on simplicity and clarity. 
			As I progressed through phase one, I found that simpler designs tended to convey the intended message more effectively and were easier for users to understand and navigate. 
			Therefore, I prioritized simplicity in my final design, opting for clean lines, minimalistic layouts, and easily understandable concepts to highlight my message.
